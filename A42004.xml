            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MAny a time ſince my Confinement in this place of <hi>Edmondsbury,</hi> both night and day I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred you, and have waited for an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to viſit you with a few lines, having no other way at preſent to manifeſt my love unto you; therefore, now it is upon my ſpirit to recommend theſe things following to your conſideration, for the encouragement of all the Travelers towards Zion, and for the comforting of all the Mourners therein, that none might faint in their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, nor be diſcouraged at theſe things, which they may meet withal, which will onely be for the tryal of their Faith, that the approved may be made manifeſt, and the Hypocrites diſcovered, and every falſe birth be brought to its end; and for this end is the Lord riſen in theſe laſt dayes, in which he hath gathered a people out of the many gatherings, and from the mouths of the falſe Shepherds, and hath brought them to the true Shepherd, even to <hi>Chriſt Jeſus the Light of the World;</hi> and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but hath given them power and ſtrength, and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to walk in the ſame Light, by which many of the myſteries of Gods Kingdom have been opened, and the myſterious working of the power of darkneſs diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by which many, as the firſt born from the dead, have walked in the Light of life, and have witneſſed the ſweet

Oh how may we ſet forth his excellent Name, who hath brought us into the way ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and hath lead us as with a cloud by day, and as by a pillar of fire by night, thus hath he taken care of us as a tender Father, and hath not left us in a day of diſtreſs, neither forſaken us in the hour of Calamity, bleſſed be his Name for evermore. Therefore, dear Brethren, and Siſters and Friends, who are made witneſſes of this the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44900:3"/>goodneſs of the Lord, and have taſted of the incombes of his life, and have been found faithful witneſſes to his truth received by you: Well, your Names ſhall not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, neither ſhall you miſs of your expected end, which is the Salvation of your Souls; you are highly favoured in his ſight, and he delights in you, you are a ſweet ſavour in his noſtrils, and as a diadem in his hand you are his choice ones, and he will never leave you, yet ſhall ye not go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryed, neither ſhall ye dwell at eaſe, but ſhall be as a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling woman, and as one that labours to bring forth her firſt born, and as labourers in the Vineyard, who ſhall receive a reward: Therefore, every one who have taſted of the goodneſs of the Father, and have drunk of the brook by the way, look not out, neither be diſcouraged at what tryals or exerciſes thou may'ſt meet withal, for now is the Lord riſen to plead with all fleſh, and to ſhake all that can be ſhaken, and all things below begins to have upon them the face of blackneſs, and people, and nations, are as the waters, or as the rowl ng waves of the Sea that cannot reſt, fear and perplexity, and diſtreſs on every ſide, a day of darkneſs ſuch as hath not been for Ages and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, is coming, a day of horror and woful lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to all the ungodly who live at eaſe, as if there was no end of their riches, neither time to waſt their delicacies; Oh the Lord hath ſeen, and the Almighty hath taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and is now come to try all the Profeſſors of his Name that the Profeſſors may be known from the poſſeſſors, and that it may be known there is a God in Iſrael, who can do whatſoever pleaſeth him; Therefore dear Friends, bleſſed are you that truſt in the Lord, and wait upon him in the Covenant of l ght, you ſhall be preſerved in peace with the Lord, and ſhall enjoy his preſence, for that is the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of our Religion, even Gods preſence, therefore put

So happy will they be that are faithful to the Lord, and have him for their guide, and take not councel of man, for rich men are vanity, and poor men are a lie, but of the Lord and of his truth there is none, for he ſets free, and gives power to all his Children to obey him, who is the God of Salvation, who leads them through many tryals, and maketh them white there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and ſupporteth them in the deepeſt exerciſe, though many at this day are ſaying as <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Maſter, ſave thy ſelf,</hi> yet we know, <hi>he that ſaveth his life ſhall looſe it, and he that looſeth his life for Chriſts ſake and the Goſpel ſhall find it;</hi> And becauſe of this our faithful Teſtimonie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are ſaying as <hi>Eliab</hi> did to <hi>David,</hi> who came down when they ſhouted to the battel, <hi>I know thy pride and the malice of thy heart, thou art come down to ſee the battel;</hi> then <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>what have I done, is there not a cauſe?</hi> And this is our cauſe at this day, wherein many are <hi>defying the Iſrael of God;</hi> though we have not neither ſhall we go out with Sword nor ſpear, neither with pride nor malice in our hearts; but in the name of the Lord, and in the ſtrength of the mighty JEHOVAH, in the meek and the quiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44900:4"/>therefore let none diſcourage you, ye valient ones, for the Lord is with us, and who can be againſt us, we ſeek not our own glory, but the glory of the Lord alone, and for his ſake have and do ſuffer grievous things, becauſe we love our peace with him, he hath cloathed us with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, which is the ſtrength of our loynes, and refreſhed us with the incombes of his life, which hath been the comfort of our hearts; therefore, let not the frowns nor flatteries of any prevail upon you in this cloudy and dark day, but ſtand ſtill and in patience wait upon the Lord, ſo ſhall you witneſs him unto you, your everlaſting reward; and as you wait upon him, in whom you have believed, ſo will you know him fitting of you, for life and death, or bonds, or liberty, for proſperity or adverſity, and in every ſtate ye will be content, ſo ſhall you be as a bride adorned for her husband, and ſhall witneſs the Lord to be with you; and though he take you from the Earth, yet are ye with him, and can make your appeals unto him, and ſay as good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did, <hi>Lord remember how I have walkt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee with an upright and with a perfect heart;</hi> the Lord will have pitty on thee, and the Almighty will ſpare thee, and gather thee unto himſelf; <hi>but fear, a ſnare, and the pit ſhall be the portion of the ungodly; for, the Sinner cannot ſtand in judgment, nor the ungodly in the Congregation of the Righteous;</hi> for now the anger of the Lord is kindled, and his arrows are flying abroad, and the deſtroying Angel is gone forth from the preſence of the Lord, by which alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy many Fathers are left Childleſs, and many a Wife now Widow, and many Children parentleſs; and yet for all this, few turn to the Lord by true repentance: Well, the Lords anger is not yet over, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill, it's yet but the beginning of ſorrow, even that I may cry and ſay, <hi>Ah ſinful Nation, ah people laden with iniquity,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44900:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>a ſeed of evil doers, will not the Lord viſit thee, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty be avenged of thee? who hath given thee line upon line, and precept upon precept, who hath corrected thee in love, that thou mighteſt return, but thou wouldſt have none of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel;</hi> and yet the Lord through his infinite love <hi>hath plucked us as brands out of the fire,</hi> and hath brought us to <hi>ſit under the Vine where none can make us afraid:</hi> And now dearly beloved Friends, who are as the firſt fruits unto God, keep your Habitations, for the time is near that that Scripture ſhall be fulfilled, which ſaith, <hi>Nation ſhall riſe up againſt Nation, and Kingdom againſt Kingdom, and every Kingdom devided againſt it ſelf ſhall not ſtand;</hi> And theſe things ye may hear and ſee, <hi>yet be not troubled,</hi> for what have we to do in this matter, <hi>our Kingdom is not of this World, neither is our Crown of rejoycing in viſible things;</hi> for it ſhall be as it hath been ſpoken, <hi>The people of the Lord ſhall dwell alone, and ſhall not be numbred amongſt the Nations.</hi> Therefore, be <hi>ſtill,</hi> be <hi>ſtill</hi> in this day, while all people out of truth, are as the troubled waters that cannot reſt, nor find peace, nor ſatisfaction in all they enjoy; therefore ye little Remnant, who are called, choſen, and beloved of the Lord keep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in the true breathing Seed, which is only ſatisfied with the incombes of the Fathers love, in that wait in the patience, and in the meek ſpirit, ſo ſhall the bleſſing, love and mercy of the Lord be your portion, and your daily recompence, from the Almighty, and happy for ever ſhall ye be that are kept faithful in your Teſtimonies, and are found in Gods Worſhip in this his day, wherein he is try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the ſons of Men, and ſifting them as wheat; the faithful ſhall be preſerved, and by the Lord be into the Garner gathered, where ſafety yee ſhall witneſs, and daily ſatisfaction enjoy from the Almighty, and ſhall be ready for your diſſolution when ever it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to call you.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:44900:5"/>
            <p> So to the hands of the Lord, and into the armes of the Almighty do I commit you all, making mention of you in my Prayers to God daily, beging that the Lord may fill refreſh and ſatisfie you with his own likeneſs, that his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer may be with you, and his glory reſt upon you, that to him ye may be as a garden of Spiees, and as Plants full of living virtue, that glory to God alone may be given, and to the Lamb, by you all for evermore. So the God of Heaven bleſs you, and water you with the dew from above and keep you in an Heavenly watchfulneſs, that as the Vallies receive the ſmall rain, ſo ye may receive power, and ſtrength from the Lord over every adverſary, enemy, tryal and temptation, that in the way of Righteouſneſs, ye may run to the end of the race, to the glory of the Lord for ever, <hi>Amen,</hi> ſaith the Soul of him, who for the Lord and his truths ſake loveth you, and remaineth your Friend and Brother in tribulation and rejoycing,</p>
